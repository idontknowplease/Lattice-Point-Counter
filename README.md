# Lattice Point Counter

This project is a fairly simple visualization project based on TKinter, there is no specific use of this except having fun. I made this for visualizing a math problem.

What does the program do?

It has a lattice point plane, and you have an initial circle, you can move the circle around, and resize it using the slider, and it will tell you how many interior lattice points occur inside the circle.

Controls - 

1). Use the slider to increase the size of the circle

2). Use arrow keys to move the circle
